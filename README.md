# Collaberative Codemirror 6 Example with React, Sockets, and Typescript

This project is here to give a reference to anyone looking how to implement the collab package from the [Codemirror documentation](https://codemirror.net/examples/collab/), with sockets instead of a worker.

It is built with React and Typescript, but those can be easily striped out.

To start the code, look at the README.md's under backend and frontend.
